- [x] make the 8 nearest neighbours mean all cells around, 24 nearest neighbours all cells and all cells around those cells, etc.
- [x] iterate over indices instead over "all agents" (?)
- [ ] plots should look like: (two series for different population sizes for the 2. and 3.)
  1. kinda x^2
  2. kinda increasing
  3. kinda log(x)
