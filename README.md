I will keep the notes from the lectures, as well as my solutions to the lab exercises in this repo.

### How to read the notes?
You can read the notes in plain markdown, github even renders the LaTeX properly sometimes, but the way it's meant to be read is with the use of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It's free, you can download it and open this repo as an Obsidian Vault, then open the [[Start]] file, and go from there.
